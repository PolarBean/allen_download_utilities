These scripts are somewhat useful for bulk downloading ISH data from the Allen Institute for Brain science :)
* data_scraper.py extracts metadata from the Allen API. You can edit it to select which subset of data you would like
* downloader.py then downloads data according to the metadata file created by data_scraper. There are filter criteria in here so you can choose to download only a subset
